For Loops in JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We use loops to perform repeated actions.
e.g - If you have a task to print numbers from 1 to 100, then it will be very hectic to do it manually.
Loops help us to automate such tasks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Loop:-

1 - for loop => loop a block of code for n number of times.
2 - for in loop => loop through keys of an object.
3 - for of loop => loop through the values of an object.
4 - while loop => loop a block based on specific condition.
5 - do-while loop => a variant of while loop whcih runs atleast once.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Loop:-

Basic symtax:-

for(statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code to be executed
}

Here,
statement 1 => is executed only once.
statement 2 => conditional statement which executes the loop.
statement 3 => executed everytime the loop body is executed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For in Loop:-

Prints the key

Syntax:-

for(key in object) {
    // code to be executed
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For of Loop:-

Prints the value

Syntax:-

for(variable of iterable) {
    // code to be executed
}

Here, iterable is a data structure like array, string etc.

NOTE: In the program, the scope of let is block level and the sscope of var is entire program
